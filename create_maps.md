# Create Maps

Similar to defining areas, there are three types of maps that can be created using the Business Analyst Web App â€“ **1) [colour-coded maps](#colour-coded-maps)**; **2) [smart map search](#smart-map-search)**; and **3) [points of interest search](#points-of-interest)**. 

## Colour-Coded Maps

Colour-coded maps assign colours to values of a variable for a particular area or geography. For example, this option will allow users to map median household income by dissemination area across a city. 

Watch the following video - *Colour-Coded Maps in Business Analyst* - to learn more about this option.

## Smart Map Search

Smart map search will filter areas on the map that meet pre-defined criteria from a selection of up to 5 variables. Where colour-coded maps show all areas, smart map search will highlight only those areas that meet the selected criteria.

Watch the following video - *Smart Map Search in Business Analyst* - to learn more about how to choose your variables and customize the ranges.

## Points of Interest

Mapping points of interest will plot the locations of business and facilities on the map. Searches can be performed using business names, categories, or NAICS and SIC codes.

For more information on this process, watch the video *Points of Interest Search in Business Analyst* below.
