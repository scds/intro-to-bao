# Define your Study Area

There are three ways to define your study area â€“ **1) [find location](#find-location)**; **2) [select geography](#select-geography)**; and **3) [drawing a polygon](#draw-polygon) around your area**. Once the study area has been defined, reports can be run and data can be limited to that area. 

The process for each method can be viewed in the following videos.

## Find Location

Study areas can be defined by searching for an address, entering the latitude/longitude coordinates, or dropping a pin on the map. The following video - *Using the Find Location tool in Business Analyst* - demonstrates this process and how to convert these locations into rings, walk or drive times, and bands.

## Select Geography

The second method to define your study area is to select the geography. Examples of available geographies include cities, postal codes, and census geographies. For more information on Canadian census geographies - see [Guide to the Census of Population - Census Geography](https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2016/ref/98-304/chap12-eng.cfm).

The following video goes through the process of *Using the Select Geography Tool in Business Analyst*.

## Draw Polygon

Lastly, study areas can be defined by drawing a polygon on the map. See the video - *Using the Draw Polygon Tool in Business Analyst* - for more information.
