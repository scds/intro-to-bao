# Export Map

One of the ways maps and results can be shared is by exporting the map to a PDF or image. This allows you to create a map containing a title, legend, and scale bar that can be included in presentations or reports.

Watch the following video - *Export a Map in Business Analyst* - to learn more about how to create your map and what file formats are available.
