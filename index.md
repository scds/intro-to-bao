# Welcome to the Intro to BAO Workshop

## What is BAO? 

The [ArcGIS Business Analyst Web App (BAO)](https://bao.arcgis.com/esriBAO/login/) is a web application that allows users to map and analyze business, demographic, and consumer spending data. Users are also able to export data, maps, and reports to Microsoft Excel, PDF, or image formats. 

The only requirements to use the program are a web browser, and an ArcGIS account. 

## Introduction to BAO 

This workshop contains several brief video tutorials from Esri to help you get started using the program. Please note, the tools and functions shown in the videos may not be available with all data sets.

Additional resources can be found under the **[Learn More](https://scds.github.io/intro-to-bao/learn-more.html)** menu. For further help, please contact [libgis@mcmaster.ca](mailto:libgis@mcmaster.ca). 

To start, see **[Workshop Preparation](https://scds.github.io/intro-to-bao/preparation.html)**.
